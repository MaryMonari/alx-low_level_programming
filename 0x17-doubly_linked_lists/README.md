A Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.Each node contains a data part and two pointers in a doubly-linked list, one for the previous node and the other for the next node.
A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions. We have the addresses of both the next node and the previous node. So, at any node, weâ€™ll have the freedom to choose between going right or left.
A node comprises three parts, the data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
Head node has the pointer to the previous node pointing to NULL.
